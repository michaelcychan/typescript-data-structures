# Binary Tree Travelersal

## Depth - First Traversal

Always traverse down each left-side branch before the right side branch

- *Preorder*: current node first, followed by left child node,  right child node
- *Inorder*: left child first, followed by current node, then right child node
- *Postorder*: left child first, followed by right child node, then current node  

Advantage of Inorder: data will be sorted from smallest to biggest
